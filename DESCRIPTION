Description: The goal of 'nestedmodels' is to allow the modelling of
    nested data. Some models only accept certain predictors. For panel
    data, it is often desirable to create a model for each panel.
    'nestedmodels' enhances the 'tidymodels' set of packages by allowing
    the user to classify a model or workflow as 'nested'.
